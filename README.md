# Cricket-Simulation
This repository simulates a 1-over cricket match using Pythonâ€™s random library. The script randomly generates outcomes for each ball, including runs, wickets, and boundaries, to simulate a match. Run the script to experience a quick, fun, and unpredictable cricket game, with commentary of my favourite commentators!
The cricket match will have random tosses, random bowler and batsman selection and also the outcomes of every ball by each batsman and bowler will be different.
