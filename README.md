# Cricket_Simulation
This repository simulates a 1-over cricket match using Pythonâ€™s random library. The script randomly generates outcomes for each ball, including runs, wickets, and boundaries, to simulate a match. Run the script to experience a quick, fun, and unpredictable cricket game, with commentary of my favourite commentators!
